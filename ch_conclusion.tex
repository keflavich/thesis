\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{ch:conclusion}
The Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey has laid the grounds for an extensive study
of dense gas within our Galaxy.

I examined the brightest sources within the BGPS, discovering 18 with masses
$M>10^4$ \msun, large enough to form bound clusters.  These sources are all
actively star-forming and can now be used for unbiased proto-cluster population
studies.

I performed follow-up studies with \formaldehyde observations from the Green
Bank Telescope and Arecibo Observatory.
