\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{ch:conclusion}
The Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey has laid the grounds for an extensive study
of dense gas within our Galaxy.

I examined the brightest sources within the BGPS, discovering 18 with masses
$M>10^4$ \msun, large enough to form bound clusters.  These sources are all
actively star-forming and can now be used for unbiased proto-cluster population
studies.  These observations allow us to place an upper limit on the starless
lifetimes of young massive clusters $\tau_{starless} < 0.6$ Myr.

I performed follow-up studies with \formaldehyde observations from the Green
Bank Telescope and Arecibo Observatory.  With these observations, I measured
the density of infalling gas around \uchii regions and of turbulent gas in
non-star-forming clouds.  I also measured the free-free contamination fraction
of BGPS sources, determining that among the brightest, the free-free contribution
to the 1.1 mm flux should be significant and perhaps even dominant.

My study of the W5 region revealed more than 50 new molecular outflows,
highlighting the star-forming sections of the cloud and distinguishing the old
from new generations.  In this cloud, the strong feedback from the
bubble-blowing OB stars drives the turbulence, not outflows from young stars.
