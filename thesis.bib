asymmetric line profile that is consistent with the superposition of two
Gaussian components. We did not detect a change in the velocity or the
line width of the Gaussian components during the flare. If the two

an event outside the maser gas triggered simultaneous flares at two

support this interpretation, given the presence of 4.5 μm excess
emission at approximately the same orientation as the centimeter
continuum. The 7 mm emission is dominated by thermal dust from a
flattened structure almost perpendicular to the ionized jet; thus, the 7
mm emission appears to trace a torus associated with a young massive
stellar object. The {H2CO} 6 cm maser is coincident with the
center of the torus-like structure. Our observations rule out radiative
pumping via radio continuum as the excitation mechanism for the

spatial density in star formation regions in our own Galaxy, we show how
the relative intensity of the 110-111 and
211-212 K-doublet transitions of {H2CO}
can provide an accurate densitometer for the active star formation
environments found in starburst galaxies. Relying on an assumed kinetic
temperature and cospatial emission and absorption from both
{H2CO} transitions, our technique is applied to a sample of 19
infrared-bright galaxies which exhibit various forms of starburst
activity. In the five galaxies of our sample where both {H2CO}
transitions were detected, we have derived spatial densities. We also
use {H2CO} to estimate the dense gas mass in our starburst
galaxy sample, finding similar mass estimates for the dense gas-forming
stars in these objects as derived using other dense gas tracers. A
related trend can be seen when one compares {LIR} to our
derived {n(H2)} for the five galaxies within which we have
derived spatial densities. Even though our number statistics are small,
there appears to be a trend toward higher spatial density for galaxies
with higher infrared luminosity. This is likely another representation
of the {LIR-Mdense} correlation.},

	abstract = {We derive the electron temperature gradient in the Galactic disk, using
a sample of H {II} regions that spans Galactocentric distances of 0-17
kpc. The electron temperature was calculated using high-precision radio
recombination line and continuum observations for more than 100 H {II}
regions. Nebular Galactocentric distances were calculated in a
consistent manner, using the radial velocities measured by our radio
recombination line survey. The large number of nebulae widely
distributed over the Galactic disk, together with the uniformity of our
data, provide a secure estimate of the present electron temperature
gradient in the Milky Way. Because metals are the main coolants in the
photoionized gas, the electron temperature along the Galactic disk
should be directly related to the distribution of heavy elements in the
Milky Way. Our best estimate of the electron temperature gradient is
derived from a sample of 76 sources for which we have the highest
quality data. The present gradient in electron temperature has a minimum
at the Galactic center and rises at a rate of 287+/-46 K
kpc-1. There are no significant variations in the value of
the gradient as a function of Galactocentric radius or azimuth. The
scatter we find in the H {II} region electron temperatures at a given
Galactocentric radius is not due to observational error, but rather to
intrinsic fluctuations in these temperatures, which are almost certainly
due to fluctuations in the nebular heavy-element abundances. Comparing
the H {II} region gradient with the much steeper gradient found for
planetary nebulae suggests that the electron temperature gradient
evolves with time, becoming flatter as a consequence of the chemical
evolution of the Milky Way's disk.},

present an atlas of {\textasciitilde}400 diffuse emission regions. New and archival data
at 90 cm for the whole survey area are also presented. Comparison of our
catalogs and images with the Midcourse Space Experiment mid-infrared
data allows us to provide preliminary discrimination between thermal and
nonthermal sources. We identify 49 high-probability supernova remnant
candidates, increasing by a factor of 7 the number of known remnants
with diameters smaller than 5' in the survey region; several are pulsar
wind nebula candidates and/or very small diameter remnants
{(D{\textless}45'').} We report the tentative identification of
several hundred H {II} regions based on a comparison with the {mid-IR}
data; they range in size from unresolved ultracompact sources to large
complexes of diffuse emission on scales of half a degree. In several of
the latter regions, cospatial nonthermal emission illustrates the
interplay between stellar death and birth. We comment briefly on plans
for follow-up observations and our extension of the survey; when
complemented by data from ongoing X-ray and {mid-IR} observations, we
expect {MAGPIS} to provide an important contribution to our understanding

the expected accuracy of the rates for excitation of formaldehyde by
collisions with He atoms which are calculated in the present paper and
to the expected differences between these rates and those for excitation
by H2 molecules which comprise a larger fraction of the interstellar
gas. The comparisons performed indicate that, for excitation by He,
calculated state-to-state rates are likely to be 50 percent accurate,

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ApJS..163..145J},
	abstract = {The Boston {University-Five} College Radio Astronomy Observatory Galactic
Ring Survey is a new survey of Galactic {13CO} J=1--{\textgreater}0
emission. The survey used the {SEQUOIA} multipixel array on the Five
College Radio Astronomy Observatory 14 m telescope to cover a longitude
range of l=18deg-55.7d and a latitude range of
{\textbar}b{\textbar}{\textless}1deg, a total of 75.4 deg2. Using both
position-switching and {On-The-Fly} mapping modes, we achieved an angular
sampling of 22", better than half of the telescope's 46" angular
resolution. The survey's velocity coverage is -5 to 135 km
s-1 for Galactic longitudes l{\textless}=40deg and -5 to
85 km s-1 for Galactic longitudes l{\textgreater}40deg. At
the velocity resolution of 0.21 km s-1, the typical rms
sensitivity is {σ(T*A){\textasciitilde}0.13} K. The survey
comprises a total of 1,993,522 spectra. We show integrated intensity
images (zeroth moment maps), channel maps, position-velocity diagrams,
and an average spectrum of the completed survey data set. We also
discuss the telescope and instrumental parameters, the observing modes,
the data reduction processes, and the emission and noise characteristics
of the data set. The Galactic Ring Survey data are available to the
community online or in {DVD} form by request.},

	abstract = {Aims. To study the structure of nearby ({\textless}500 pc) dense starless and
star-forming cores with the particular goal to identify and understand
evolutionary trends in core properties, and to explore the nature of
Very Low Luminosity Objects (≤0.1 Lȯ; {VeLLOs).}
Methods: Using the {MAMBO} bolometer array, we create maps unusually
sensitive to faint (few {mJy} per beam) extended (≈5 arcmin) thermal
dust continuum emission at 1.2 mm wavelength. Complementary information
on embedded stars is obtained from Spitzer, {IRAS,} and {2MASS.} Results:
Our maps are very rich in structure, and we characterize extended
emission features (“subcores”) and compact intensity peaks
in our data separately to pay attention to this complexity. We derive,
e.g., sizes, masses, and aspect ratios for the subcores, as well as
column densities and related properties for the peaks. Combination with
archival infrared data then enables the derivation of bolometric
luminosities and temperatures, as well as envelope masses, for the young
embedded stars. Conclusions: Starless and star-forming cores occupy
the same parameter space in many core properties; a picture of dense
core evolution in which any dense core begins to actively form stars
once it exceeds some fixed limit in, e.g., mass, density, or both, is
inconsistent with our data. A concept of necessary conditions for star
formation appears to provide a better description: dense cores
fulfilling certain conditions can form stars, but they do not need to,
respectively have not done so yet. Comparison of various evolutionary
indicators for young stellar objects in our sample (e.g., bolometric
temperatures) reveals inconsistencies between some of them, possibly
suggesting a revision of some of these indicators. Finally, we challenge
the notion that {VeLLOs} form in cores not expected to actively form
stars, and we present a first systematic study revealing evidence for
structural differences between starless and candidate {VeLLO} cores.

	abstract = {Stellar clusters are born embedded within giant molecular clouds {(GMCs)}
and during their formation and early evolution are often only visible at
infrared wavelengths, being heavily obscured by dust. Over the past 15
years advances in infrared detection capabilities have enabled the first
systematic studies of embedded clusters in galactic molecular clouds. In
this article we review the current state of empirical knowledge
concerning these extremely young protocluster systems. From a survey of
the literature we compile the first extensive catalog of galactic
embedded clusters. We use the catalog to construct the mass function and
estimate the birthrate for embedded clusters within 2 kpc of the sun. We
find that the embedded cluster birthrate exceeds that of visible open
clusters by an order of magnitude or more indicating a high infant
mortality rate for protocluster systems. Less than 4-7\% of embedded
clusters survive emergence from molecular clouds to become bound
clusters of Pleiades age. The vast majority (90\%) of stars that form in
embedded clusters form in rich clusters of 100 or more members with
masses in excess of 50 Mȯ. Moreover, observations of
nearby cloud complexes indicate that embedded clusters account for a
significant (70-90\%) fraction of all stars formed in {GMCs.} We review the
role of embedded clusters in investigating the nature of the initial
mass function {(IMF)} that, in one nearby example, has been measured over
the entire range of stellar and substellar mass, from {OB} stars to
substellar objects near the deuterium burning limit. We also review the
role embedded clusters play in the investigation of circumstellar disk
evolution and the important constraints they provide for understanding
the origin of planetary systems. Finally, we discuss current ideas
concerning the origin and dynamical evolution of embedded clusters and
the implications for the formation of bound open clusters.},

the Large Magellanic Cloud, we derive a new calibration of
Mυ with spectral class. With these new calibrations and
the stellar atmosphere models of Kurucz, we calculate the physical

He0 continua for O and early B-type stars. We find
substantial differences between our values of the Lyman- continuum
luminosity and those reported in the literature. We also discuss the
systematic discrepancy between O-type stellar masses derived from
spectroscopic models and those derived from evolutionary tracks. Most
likely, the cause of this "mass discrepancy" lies primarily in the
atmospheric models, which are plane parallel and hydrostatic and
therefore do not account for an extended atmosphere and the velocity
fields in a stellar wind. Finally, we present a new computation of the
Lyman-continuum luminosity from 429 known O stars located within 2.5 kpc

{(L=1100Lsun\_)} and shows evidence for an energetic outflow and
ongoing star formation (a cluster of low-mass stars has formed inside
the cloud). {CG5} is presently undergoing a second episode of
photo-ionisation from a cluster of O stars in the nebula, characterised
by a shock at the surface of the cloud; the shock was detected in
several millimeter lines {(CO,} {CS)} and in the thermal continuum dust
emission. Photo-ionisation conditions at the surface of the globule were
estimated from measurements of the {VLA} free-free continuum emission. A
virial analysis suggests that {CG5} is probably permeated by a static
magnetic field of strength {={\textasciitilde}125μG} and is subject to an outer
pressure 4 times as large as its inner pressure. It is in a globally
magnetically subcritical state whereas its core is close to virial
equilibrium. Photo-ionisation is found to play a key role in the
evolution of {CG5} because a) it confines the molecular gas and contains
the gas dispersal favored by the energy injection from the outflow while
evaporating the superficial layers at the same time, b) the overpressure
of the compressed gas ahead of the ionisation front is sufficient to
trigger the collapse of initially (sub)critical condensations inside the
cloud and initiate star formation. We find that the outflow contains
enough momentum to have contributed to this star-formation process. In
addition, the energy of the outflow is sufficient to sustain turbulence
in the cloud and maintain it in a magnetically subcritical state, i.e.
it tends to stabilize the cloud against collapse and regulate star
formation.},

	abstract = {Competitive accretion, a process to explain the origin of the initial
mass function {(IMF),} occurs when stars in a common gravitational
potential accrete from a distributed gaseous component. Stars located
near the centre of the potential benefit from the gravitational
attraction of the full potential and accrete at much higher rates than
do isolated stars. We show that concerns recently raised on the
efficiency of competitive accretion are incorrect as they use globally
averaged properties which are inappropriate for the detailed physics of
a forming stellar cluster. A full treatment requires a realistic
treatment of the cluster potential, the distribution of turbulent
velocities and gas densities. Accreting gas does not travel at the
global virial velocity of the system due to the velocity-sizescale
relation inherent in turbulent gas and due to the lower velocity
dispersion of {small-N} clusters in which much of the accretion occurs.
Accretion occurs due to the effect of the local potential in funnelling
gas down to the centre. Stars located in the gas-rich centres of such
systems initially accrete from low relative velocity gas attaining
larger masses before needing to accrete the higher velocity gas. Stars
not in the centres of such potentials, or that enter the cluster later
when the velocity dispersion is higher, do not accrete significantly and
thus retain their low masses. In competitive accretion, most stars do
not continue to accrete significantly such that their masses are set
from the fragmentation process. It is the few stars which continue to
accrete that become higher-mass stars. Competitive accretion is
therefore likely to be responsible for the formation of higher-mass
stars and can explain the mass distribution, mass segregation and binary
frequency of these stars. Global kinematics of competitive accretion
models include large-scale mass infall, with mean inflow velocities of
the order of {\textasciitilde}0.5 kms-1 at scales of 0.5pc, but infalling
signatures are likely to be confused by the large tangential velocities
and the velocity dispersion present. Finally, we discuss potential
limitations of competitive accretion and conclude that competitive
accretion is currently the most likely model for the origin of the
high-mass end of the {IMF.}},

	abstract = {It is generally believed that expanding superbubbles and mechanical
feedback from massive stars trigger star formation, because there are
numerous examples of superbubbles showing secondary star formation at
their edges. However, although these systems show an age sequence, they
do not provide strong evidence of a causal relationship. The {W3/W4}
Galactic star-forming complex suggests a three-generation hierarchy: the
supergiant shell structures correspond to the oldest generation; these
triggered the formation of {IC} 1795 in W3, the progenitor of a molecular
superbubble that in turn triggered the current star-forming episodes in
the embedded regions {W3-North,} {W3-Main,} and {W3-OH.} We present {UBV}
photometry and spectroscopic classifications for {IC} 1795, which show an
age of 3-5 Myr. This age is intermediate between the reported 6-20 Myr
age of the supergiant shell system and the extremely young ages
(104-105 yr) for the embedded knots of the
ultracompact H {II} regions, {W3-North,} {W3-Main,} and {W3-OH.} Thus, an age
sequence is indeed confirmed for the entire {W3/W4} hierarchical system.

superbubble action and mechanical feedback are indeed a triggering
mechanism for star formation.},

We identified eight {13CO} molecular clouds (three of them are

of the clouds and clumps range from 460 to 36 000 Mȯ and
from 55 to 740 Mȯ, respectively. The peak
{13CO} column densities of the clouds facing the H ii region

integrated intensity peaks of {13CO,} whereas most Class {II}

to the exciting star. Conclusions: The alignments of the {YSO} candidates
and the molecular clouds in order of age indicate that triggered star
formation occurs in the {W5-East} H ii region as a
result of gas compression by strong {UV} radiation. Based on the column
densities of {13CO} and the spatial distribution of {YSO}

	abstract = {Context: Massive young stellar objects {(MYSO)} are surrounded by massive
dusty envelopes, whose physical structure and geometry are determined by
the star formation process. Aims: Our principal aim is to establish the
density structure of {MYSO} envelopes on scales of {\textasciitilde}1000 {AU.} This
constitutes an increase of a factor {\textasciitilde}10 in angular resolution compared
to similar studies performed in the (sub)mm. Methods: We have obtained
diffraction-limited (0.6´´) 24.5 μm images (field of view
of 40 arcsec×30 arcsec) of 14 well-known massive star formation
regions with the {COMICS} instrument mounted on the 8.2 m Subaru
telescope. We construct azimuthally averaged intensity profiles of the
resolved {MYSO} envelopes and build spectral energy distributions {(SEDs)}
from archival data and the {COMICS} 24.5 μm flux density. The {SEDs}
range from near-infrared to millimeter wavelengths. Self-consistent {1-D}
radiative transfer models described by a density dependence of the form
n(r) ∝ r-p are used to simultaneously compare the
intensity profiles and {SEDs} to model predictions. Results: The images
reveal the presence of discrete {MYSO} sources which are resolved on
arcsecond scales, and, to first-order, the observed emission is circular
on the sky. For many sources, the spherical models are capable of
satisfactorily reproducing the 24.5 μm intensity profile, the 24.5
μm flux density, the 9.7 μm silicate absorption feature, and the
submm emission. They are described by density distributions with p
=1.0±0.25. Such distributions are shallower than those found on
larger scales probed with single-dish (sub)mm studies. Other sources
have density laws that are shallower/steeper than p=1.0 and there is
evidence that these are viewed near edge-on or near face-on
respectively. In these cases spherical models fail to provide good fits
to the data. The images also reveal a diffuse component tracing somewhat
larger scale structures, particularly visible in the regions S 140, {AFGL}
2136, {IRAS} 20126+4104, Mon R2, and Cep A. Conclusions: We find a
flattening of the {MYSO} density law going from scales probed with
single-dish submm observations down to scales of {\textasciitilde}1000 {AU} probed with
the observations presented here. We propose that this may be evidence of
rotational support of the envelope. This finding will be explored
further in a future paper using {2-D} axisymmetric radiative transfer
models.

Based on data collected at the Subaru telescope, which is operated by
the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.},

	abstract = {We present a detailed study of outflow activity in a sample of 45
low-luminosity embedded young stellar objects {(YSOs).} We use maps in the
J=2-1 line of {{\textasciicircum}12{\textasciicircum}CO} to characterize this activity for {YSOs} that are
still sufficiently embedded to show molecular outflows. Our {CO} outflow
survey benefits from coordinated millimeter continuum measurements of
circumstellar masses which allow us to estimate the evolutionary states
of the central driving sources. Our sample comprises 36 {near-IR} {(Class}
I) protostars and 9 {far-IR/submm} {(Class} 0) protostars, and should be
representative of the ``self-embedded'' phase of (low-mass) protostellar
evolution characterizing young stars still surrounded by significant
circumstellar envelopes. We find that virtually all the objects in our
sample have detectable {CO} outflow activity. We make homogeneous
estimates of the outflow momentum flux deposited in the close
environment of the driving sources in order to assess the dynamical
properties of the underlying driving winds/jets. As is well-known, a
tight correlation between outflow energetics and driving source
luminosity is found for Class I sources. However, Class 0 sources lie a
factor of {\textasciitilde}10 above this correlation, suggesting they have qualitatively
different (e.g., more powerful) {CO} outflows. In addition, we find that
the outflow momentum flux correlates well with the circumstellar
envelope mass of the exciting source for both Class I and Class 0
sources. We show that this new correlation is independent of the
{F\_CO\_-L\_bol\_} correlation and most likely results from a more or less
continuous decrease of outflow power with time during the accretion
phase. For a young star of final mass {{\textasciitilde}0.6Msun\_,} the outflow
momentum flux is typically {F\_CO\_{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}-4{\textasciicircum}Msun\_.km/s/yr} at the
early Class 0 stage and {F\_CO\_{\textasciitilde}2x10{\textasciicircum}-6{\textasciicircum}Msun\_.km/s/yr} at the
late Class I stage. We suggest that this decrease of outflow energetics
reflects a corresponding decay in the mass accretion/infall rate.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT} As part of a James Clerk Maxwell Telescope {(JCMT)} Legacy Survey
of star formation in the Gould Belt, we present early science results
for Taurus. {CO} J = 3 -2 maps have been secured along the north-west
ridge and bowl, collectively known as L 1495, along with deep
{13CO} and {C18O} J = 3 -2 maps in two subregions.
With these data, we search for molecular outflows, and use the
distribution of flows, {Herbig-Haro} {(HH)} objects and shocked
H2 line-emission features, together with the population of
young stars, protostellar cores and starless condensations to map star
formation across this extensive region. In total, 21 outflows are
identified. It is clear that the bowl is more evolved than the ridge,
harbouring a greater population of T Tauri stars and a more diffuse,
more turbulent ambient medium. By comparison, the ridge contains a much
younger, less widely distributed population of protostars which, in
turn, is associated with a greater number of molecular outflows. We
estimate the ratio of the numbers of pre-stellar to protostellar cores
in L 1495 to be {\textasciitilde}1.3-2.3, and of gravitationally unbound starless cores
to (gravitationally bound) pre-stellar cores to be {\textasciitilde}1. If we take
previous estimates of the protostellar lifetime of {\textasciitilde}5 ×
105 yr, this indicates a pre-stellar lifetime of 9(+/-3)
× 105 yr. From the number of outflows, we also crudely
estimate the star formation efficiency in L 1495, finding it to be
compatible with a canonical value of 10-15 per cent. We note that
molecular outflow-driving sources have redder near-infrared colours than
their {HH} jet-driving counterparts. We also find that the smaller, denser
cores are associated with the more massive outflows, as one might expect
if mass build-up in the flow increases with the collapse and contraction
of the protostellar envelope.},

	volume = {472},
	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007A%26A...472..187H},
	abstract = {Context: We present a search for outflows towards 51 submillimetre cores
in the Perseus molecular cloud.
Aims: Our first objective is to
identify the protostellar population through the detection of molecular
outflows. Our second aim is to consistently derive outflow properties
from a large homogeneous dataset within one molecular cloud in order to
investigate further the mass dependence and time evolution of
protostellar mass loss.
Methods: We used the James Clerk Maxwell
Telescope to map 2' × 2' regions around each core in
{12CO} 3-2. Where molecular outflows were detected we derived
momentum fluxes.
Results: Of the 51 cores, 37 show broad
linewings indicative of molecular outflows. In 13 cases, the linewings
could be due to confusion with neighbouring flows but 9 of those sources
also have near-infrared detections confirming their protostellar nature.
The total fraction of protostars in our sample is 65\%. All but four
outflow detections are confirmed as protostellar by Spitzer {IR}
detections and only one Spitzer source has no outflow, showing that
outflow maps at this sensitivity are equally good at identifying
protostars as Spitzer. Outflow momentum flux correlates both with source
luminosity and with core mass but there is considerable scatter even
within this one cloud despite the homogeneous dataset. We fail to
confirm the result of Bontemps et al. (1996) that Class I sources show
lower momentum fluxes on average than Class 0 sources, with a {KS} test
showing a significant probability that the momentum fluxes for both
Class 0s and Class Is are drawn from the same distribution.
Conclusions: We find that outflow power may not show a simple decline
between the Class 0 to Class I stages. Our sample includes low momentum
flux, low-luminosity Class 0 sources, possibly at a very early
evolutionary stage. If the only mass loss from the core were due to
outflows, cores would last for 10{\textasciicircum}5-108 years, longer than
current estimates of 1.5-4 × 105 years for the mean
lifetime for the embedded phase. Additional mechanisms for removing mass
from protostellar cores may be necessary.

	0.185 +/- 0.010 mas, corresponding to a distance of 5.41 (+0.31/-0.28)
	kpc. W51 Main/South is a well-known massive star-forming region near
	the tangent point of the Sagittarius spiral arm of the Milky Way.
	Our distance to W51 yields an estimate of the distance to the Galactic
	center of Ro = 8.3 +/- 0.46 (statistical) +/- 1.0 (systematic) kpc
	by simple geometry. Combining the parallax and proper motion measurements
	for W51, we obtained the full-space motion of this massive star forming
	region. We find W51 is in a nearly circular orbit about the Galactic
	center. The H2O masers used for our parallax measurements trace four
	powerful bipolar outflows within a 0.4 pc size region, some of which
	are associated with dusty molecular hot cores and/or hyper- or ultra-compact
	HII regions.},
