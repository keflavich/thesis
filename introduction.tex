\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Preface}
This thesis\footnote{Necessarily the first two words of a thesis?} describes
the research I have performed with a wide variety of collaborators, mostly
centered on the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey team led by John Bally and Jason
Glenn.  The BGPS data reduction process, at the core of this work, was done in 
collaboration with James Aguirre and Erik Rosolowsky.

However, the work proceeded somewhat haphazardly: I came into the BGPS team as
the rare student enthusiastic about data reduction.  I never planned to take
over the BGPS data, but it happened a few years into my time at CU.  This
thesis is therefore somewhat scattered: some of the observations reported here
were taken as `follow-up' to the BGPS before it was completed.

This document primarily consists of a number of published papers centered
around a common theme of radio and millimeter observations of the Galaxy, but
without an obvious common driving question.  I have therefore added
thesis-specific introductions to each section to describe where they fit in to
the bigger picture of this document.  I've also included sections describing
work that is not yet published but (hopefully) soon will be.

\section{Star Formation in the Galaxy}
It has been known for at least half a century that stars form from the
gravitational collapse of clouds of cool material.  The gas that will
eventually form stars is typically observed as dark features obscuring
background stars.  The brighter nebulae, which have been studied for far longer
\citep{Messier1764}, contain hot and diffuse gas.  These nebulae, while
spectacular, are not the construction materials of new stars.  However,
they mark the locations where new stars have formed - nebulae are often
stellar nurseries.

To track down the cool star-forming material, it is necessary to observe at
longer wavelengths.  Infrared observations can pierce through obscuring
material, as dust becomes more transparent at longer wavelengths.  With near-
and mid-infrared observations, such as those enabled by HgCdTe detectors like
those in the NICFPS and TripleSpec instruments at Apache Point Observatory and
the InSb detectors used on the Spitzer Space Telescope, it is possible to
observe obscured young stars.  These objects have just ignited fusion in their
cores and represent the youngest generation of new stars.

But this material has already formed stars.  To see the truly cold stuff, that
which still has potential to form new stars, we need to examine gas that is not
heated at all by stars.  Assuming we want to look for gas that can form a star
like our sun and that the density of the gas to form is $\sim10^4$ particles
per cubic centimeter (an assumption left unjustified for now), the Jeans scale
requires a temperature $T\sim10$ K, which means we need to look at wavelengths
$\lambda \gtrsim 100 \um$ in order to observe this gas.

Gas at these densities turns out to be quite rare.  While there are thousands
of stars within 100 pc of the sun, the closest known star-forming globules are
at distances greater than 100 pc.  While this sparsity is explained in part by
our current position in the Galaxy (we're buzzing along its outskirts at 250
\kms), it reflects the reality that star formation in the present epoch is
dispersed and rare.

Even more rare are the massive stars that end their lives in supernovae.  While there
are hundreds of stellar nurseries within a few hundred parsecs, the nearest
region of massive star formation is the Orion Molecular Cloud at a distance of
400 pc.  Out to 1000 pc, though, there are still only a handful of massive star
forming regions, including Monoceros R2 and Cepheus A.

These massive stars in many ways are the most important to study in order to
understand the evolution of gas and dust in the universe and our own origins.
In their deaths, they produce the heavy elements required to form dust,
planets, and life.  Throughout their lives and deaths, massive stars dump
energy into the interstellar medium and effectively control the motions and
future of the gas around them.

The bigger the star, the shorter it lives, so massive stars are nearly as rare
as their birth regions.  They also tend to be found nearby or within these
birth regions.  Since they can be found near large globs of dust, finding these
globs can help us discover new groups of massive stars.

This thesis summarizes surveys within our Galaxy to discover and examine
regions forming.  The largest body of work described here is the Bolocam
Galactic Plane Survey, the first dust continuum survey of a significant
fraction of the Galactic Plane.

With that broad overview in place, the next sections describe a few of the
specific problems addressed in this thesis in greater detail.

\subsection{Turbulence}
Turbulence is one of the defining features of the interstellar medium.
Turbulence is thought to govern many properties of the ISM, rendering it
scale-free and defining the distribution of velocities, densities,
temperatures, and magnetic fields in the gas between stars.

Turbulence is most easily modeled by a Kolmogorov spectrum, in which $\Delta v
\propto \ell^{1/3}$, i.e. the typical velocity dispersion is greatest at the
largest size scales.  Kolmogorov turbulence strictly only describes
incompressible fluids without magnetic fields, while the ISM is compressible
and threaded by magnetic fields.  Nonetheless, Kolmogorov turbulence is nearly
consistent with some observed properties of the ISM.  The Larson size-linewidth
relation, in particular, is similar to that predicted by Kolmogorov turbulence.

Turbulence is often quoted as a source of \emph{pressure} based on the
Kolmogorov description.  At size scales much smaller than the driving scale of
the turbulence (the ``box size'' in a simulation), turbulence becomes isotropic
and can add support against gravitational collapse.  

However, turbulence decays rapidly.  The turbulent decay timescale
$\tau_{decay}\propto L / v$, where $L$ is the turbulent length scale and $v$ is
the velocity scale.  It therefore increases with size scale as
$\tau_{decay}\propto L^{2/3}$.  Turbulence decays most quickly on the smallest
timescales.

We are therefore left with two conditions: Turbulence must be driven at large
scales for turbulence to provide support against gravity, and it must be
constantly driven to resupply the turbulence that is transferred to heat on the
smallest scales.

Because the ISM is compressible, interacting flows within the turbulent medium
will result in density enhancements and voids.  Many simulation studies have
determined that the resulting density distribution, and correspondingly the
column-density distribution, should be approximately log-normal.  Observational
studies agree that in regions not yet significantly affected by gravity, the 
column-density distribution is log-normal.  In regions where stars are actively
forming, a high-density power-law tail forms.

One theory of star formation holds that the initial mass function of stars is
determined entirely by turbulence.  In this description, the highest
overdensities in the turbulent medium become gravitationally unstable and
separate from the turbulent flow as they collapse into proto-stellar cores.

\subsection{Mass Functions}
Perhaps the most fundamental goal of star formation studies is to determine the
Initial Mass Function (IMF) of stars and what, if anything, causes it to vary.
It is also one of the most challenging statistically and observationally.

The IMF defines the probability distribution function of stellar masses at
birth, and therefore differs greatly from the present-day stellar mass function
that is very strongly affected by stellar death at the highest masses.  In
order to determine the mass function for the most massive stars, it is
necessary to look at their birth places.  These birth places are dusty, dense,
and rare.  

It remains somewhat unclear whether the IMF is a universal function or is sampled
independently for individual clusters.  If it is universal, there is a possibility of
forming massive stars anywhere stars form.  If cluster-dependent, then a massive star
must form with a surrounding cluster.

Some groups now claim that the initial mass function is decided in the gas
phase by the formation of cores.  The Core Mass Function measures the
probability distribution function of core masses, where cores are generally
identified observationally as column-density peaks in millimeter/submillimeter
emission maps.  The CMF has a similar functional form to the IMF, but its mean
is higher by a factor $\sim3$ in local star forming regions, leading to the claim
that star formation proceeds from CMF->IMF with 30\% efficiency.

Gas clouds follow a mass function that extends up to the largest
possible coherent scales, giant molecular clouds with scales $\sim50-100$ pc
that are limited by the scale-height of the ISM in Galactic disks.
Between `cores' and GMCs, intermediate scale blobs are often called `clumps'. 
The mass function of these clumps has yet to be determined.  

The mass function of GMCs was determine from CO emission towards the Galactic
plane and in nearby galaxies (e.g., M33) where they can be resolved.  The CMF
was measured in nearby clouds where 30\arcsec\ beams easily resolve $\sim0.1$
pc cores.  However, clumps are only found in large numbers in the Galactic
plane, where distances are uncertain.  They cannot be resolved in other
galaxies (except by ALMA now).

To understand star formation on a galactic scale, it is necessary to understand
the transition from large-scale giant molecular clouds and proto-stellar cores.
Clouds follow a shallow mass function, with the largest clouds containing most
of the gas.  Cores and stars are both drawn from steep mass functions in which
most of the mass near some peak in the distribution.  Presumably there must be
some intermediate state of the gas that is drawn from an intermediate
distribution, shallower than `cores' but steeper than `clouds'.  

\subsubsection{Clusters}
Clusters are also drawn from a mass function comparable to stars, but
ironically their distribution is better measured than for stars.  Clusters are
easily visible - and resolvable - in other galaxies, and massive clusters are
less likely to be embedded than massive stars.  In normal galaxies, cluster
populations are consistent with a Schechter distribution: a power-law
$\alpha\sim2$ with an exponential cutoff at large masses.

Since clusters are not drawn from the same parent distribution as GMCs (which
have $\alpha\sim1$), it is plausible that their precursors are, instead, the
intermediate-scale `clumps' observed in the millimeter continuum.  However, the
clump mass function has yet to be measured, so even this first step of
determining plausibility is incomplete.

Clusters are an important observational tool in astrophysics.  For stellar
studies, they have been used to select populations of co-eval stars.  In
extragalactic studies, they are frequently the smallest observable individual
units.  However, many recent works have pointed out that clusters may be
short-lived, transient phenomena.  Any study of their populations must take
in to account their dissolution.  The most massive clusters, however, are both
the most easily observed and the longest lived, and therefore provide some of the
most useful tools for understanding stars.

As with massive stars, massive clusters are rare.  Only a handful of young
massive clusters are known within our Galaxy, including the most massive,  NGC
3603, the Arches cluster, and Westerlund 1 \citep{PortegiesZwart2010}.  These
are the only locations in the galaxy known to be forming multiple stars near
the (possible) upper stellar mass limit.  Despite their importance, though,
only a handful of these clusters are known and the population of such clusters
is effectively unconstrained.  The incomplete knowledge of clusters is due to
extinction  and confusion within the plane.
