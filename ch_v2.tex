\chapter{The Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey}
\label{ch:v2}

\section{Preface}
The Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey consumed the bulk of my time on this thesis.
A great deal of that time was dedicated to development of the BGPS Pipeline
(Section \ref{sec:bgpspipeline}).  That software is described in \citet{Aguirre2011}
and this chapter.

\section{Version 1}
The Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS) Version 1 (\vone) was released in 2009 and published in
\citet{Aguirre2011} and \citet{Rosolowsky2010}.  \citet{Aguirre2011} summarizes 
a great deal of the work in this thesis, in particular the reduction strategy
implemented for the BGPS.  However, since that paper was written in cooperation
with James Aguirre, the text is not reproduced here and instead references to
the paper are included within the description of \vtwo below.
