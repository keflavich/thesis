\chapter{The Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey}
\label{ch:v2}

\section{Preface}
The Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey consumed the bulk of my time on this thesis.
A great deal of that time was dedicated to development of the BGPS Pipeline
(Section \ref{sec:bgpspipeline}).  That software is described in \citet{Aguirre2011}
and this chapter.

\subsection{Version 1}
The Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS) Version 1 (\vone) was released in 2009
and published in \citet{Aguirre2011} and \citet{Rosolowsky2010}.
\citet{Aguirre2011} summarizes a great deal of the work on the BGPS pipeline,
in particular the reduction strategy we implemented.  However, since that paper
was written in cooperation with James Aguirre, the text is not reproduced here
and instead references to the paper are included within the description of
\vtwo below.
