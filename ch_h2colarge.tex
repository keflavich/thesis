\chapter{\formaldehyde observations of BGPS sources not previously observed with Arecibo}


\section{Preface} 

Given our success with the simple 4-hour GBT observation of $\sim20$ sources,
it was decided that a large-scale survey of BGPS sources accessible to Arecibo
and the GBT would be productive.  We therefore selected 400 pointings in the
Arecibo-accessible declination range, 137 of which are in the outer galaxy
($172<\ell<207$) and the others in the inner galaxy ($31<\ell<65$).

The selected sources included \emph{all} peaks in the outer galaxy regions,
including the newly observed regions from the BGPS \vtwo survey.

As of the thesis defense, all of the data for the large survey has been reduced,
but the analysis and interpretation is ongoing.  We report here only initial
results from the outer galaxy component of the large survey.

Further follow-up projects based on these observations, in particular VLA
observations of the W51 star forming complex, have been approved and are
queued for observation.

The following section describes portions of the \formaldehyde observations focusing
on the outer galaxy in detail.

\section{\formaldehyde Mapping}
We were lucky enough to be awarded \emph{double} the time we asked for on the GBT,
allowing us to observe large areas in mapping mode.  
Naturally, we picked the brightest and best-known regions for mapping studies.

In the inner galaxy, we mapped out an area $\sim50\arcmin\times20\arcmin$ centered
on the W51 massive star forming complex.  This region is ideally suited to study from Arecibo,
the GBT, and the VLA, since it is at declination +14 and is one of the brightest continuum
sources in the Galactic plane.  It also turns out to be the nearest proto-massive cluster
at a VLBI-parallax-measured distance of 5.1 kpc (see Chapter \ref{ch:ympc} for a discussion
of massive proto-clusters).  The simple reduction of this data is nearly complete, but 
analysis has not yet begun.

In the outer galaxy, we targeted two regions: the Sh 255 complex in Gem OB1 and
the Sh 233-IR/IRAS 05358 complex I studied for my Comps II project.  We made
small ($\sim 5\arcmin\times 5\arcmin$) maps of these objects in order to
evaluate the density profiles and determine what systematic biases may have
been present in our single-pointing observations.  These outer galaxy sources
are both at $D<2$ kpc, so our resolution is $\lesssim 0.5 pc$ and we therefore
have some marginal hope of discovering dense cores without diluting their
signal too badly.

\subsection{\formaldehyde maps of S233IR}
For the S233IR region, we were able to create a density map, but found the
surprising and counterintuitive result that the density was smallest at the
peak of the BGPS 1.1 mm emission.  The ``envelope'' is at a nearly constant density
$n\sim10^{3.5}\percc$, but the core is either at a low density (which is effectively
ruled out on other considerations) or is significantly self-absorbed.  It turns out 
that \formaldehyde \twotwo \emph{emission} fills in the absorption.

Figure \ref{fig:s233irmulti} shows the mapping results for the S233 IR region, where
`envelope' densities are measured to be $n\sim10^{3.3}-10^{3.7} \percc$, but the `core'
density is more weakly constrained to be $10^{4.5}\percc < n < 10^{5.5}\percc$ based
on the presence of \formaldehyde \twotwo emission and the absence of \oneone emission.
The lack of a direct measurement makes density profile measurement with the current
observations impossible. 

The moderate densities observed in the envelopes are nonetheless an order of
magnitude higher than typical volume-averaged GMC densities
\citep{Roman-Duval2010} as was previously noted for ordinary GMCs with
\formaldehyde detections in \citet{Ginsburg2011}. 

Perhaps most interesting is the contrast between the two BGPS sources shown 
in Figure \ref{fig:s233irmulti}.  In \citet{Ginsburg2009}, I examined primarily
S233IR, but its neighboring region G173.58+2.45 is also a well-studied proto-cluster.
Unlike S233IR, which has a B1/B2 10 \msun star that is probably still accreting,
G173.58 contains no massive stars and has an upper mass limit $M\lesssim4 \msun$
\citep{Shepherd2002}.  The \formaldehyde observations reveal that the density in this
clump is $\sim10^{3.6} \percc$, substantially less than the expected $n\sim10^5 \percc$
in the massive-star forming S233IR.

The BGPS data show this difference as well, but less strikingly.  In the BGPS
data, the inferred masses of S233IR and G173 are 840 and 190 \msun,
respectively, though lower by a factor of $\sim2$ in each when considering only
their condensed $r\lesssim0.4$ pc cores.  Their densities differ by a smaller
amount using the BGPS data and assuming spherical symmetry, with peak densities
$n\sim10^{4.1}$ in G173 and $n\sim10^{4.8}$ in S233IR.  The density difference
reinforces the conclusion drawn from the \formaldehyde data, but also show that its
density measuring power is greater, since the spherical symmetry assumption is known
to be flawed.

% S233IR:
% peak column: 6.09*2.08e22*(np.exp(13.01/20)-1)  = 1.16e23

% mass is then 9.2 * 1.8**2 * 14.3 * (np.exp(13.01/20)-1)  = 400 msun (600 by other measures; close enough)
% radius ~30 arsec ~ 0.3pc
% n ~ 6.7e4, 10^4.8
% TOTAL flux/mass, in full aperture, is 471/23.8=19.7 Jy, or 840 msun

% G173:
% flux ~62 Jy/bm, /ppbeam = 2.6 Jy ~ 2.6 * 1.8**2 * 14 = 120 msun
% TOTAL 107 Jy/beam /ppbeam=4.5 -> 190 msun
% radius = 40 arcsec = 0.35 pc
% density = 120 * 2e33 / (4/3*np.pi*(0.35*3.08e18)**3) / ( 2.8 * 1.67e-24 ) = 1.3e4

\subsection{W51}
The W51 survey was completed in September 2011.  The data reduction process
presented unique challenges: at C-band, the entire region surveyed contains
continuum emission, so no truly suitable `off' position was found within the
survey data.  Similarly, \formaldehyde is ubiquitous across the region, so it
was necessary to `mask out' the absorption lines when building an off position.
This was done by interpolating across the line-containing region with a
polynomial fit.

spectrum.  The line-containing regions for each polarization are shown in cyan
and purple, with the interpolated replacement in red and green.
}{fig:h2comask}{0.4}{0}

The W51 data are converted into ``optical depth'' data cubes by dividing the
integrated \formaldehyde absorption signature by the measured continuum level.
These $\tau$ cubes are then fit with the RADEX models used for other
\formaldehyde fitting.  However, there are multiple velocity components in W51,
so I used a two-component (unconstrained) fit for each pixel, which is
frequently unstable but in the case of W51 looks to have produced reasonable
results.

A first interesting note is that a local cloud at $v_{lsr}\sim5 \kms$ is
detected in \formaldehyde \oneone across most of the cloud and not detected at
\twotwo, with $\tau_{\oneone}/\tau_{\twotwo} \gtrsim 3$, implying a
very low column
$N_{\formaldehyde}\sim10^{11.5}$ or $N_{\hh} \sim 10^{20.5}$.  
The cloud is seen in \thirteenco as a very weak, diffuse feature, and in HI absorption
as a very sharp, deep (self)-absorption feature.
% This density measurement
% is consistent with observations from \citet{Ginsburg2011} of high density in
% GMCs.  However, GMCs are generally thought of as being low-density clouds, so
% this result may be surprising.
