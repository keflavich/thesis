\chapter{\formaldehyde observations of BGPS sources not previously observed with Arecibo}
\label{ch:h2colarge}

\section{Preface} 

Given our success with the simple 4-hour GBT observation of $\sim20$ sources,
it was decided that a large-scale survey of BGPS sources accessible to Arecibo
and the GBT would be productive.  We therefore selected 400 pointings in the
Arecibo-accessible declination range, 137 of which are in the outer galaxy
($172<\ell<207$) and the others in the inner galaxy ($31<\ell<65$).

The selected sources included \emph{all} 1.1 mm peaks in the outer galaxy
regions of the BGPS, including the newly observed regions from the \vtwo
survey.

As of the thesis defense, all of the data for the large survey has been reduced,
but the analysis and interpretation is ongoing.  We report here only initial
results from the outer galaxy component of the large survey and selected analysis
from the inner galaxy survey.

Further follow-up projects based on these observations, in particular VLA
observations of the W51 star forming complex, have been approved and are
queued for observation.

% The following section describes portions of the \formaldehyde observations focusing
% on the outer galaxy in detail.
