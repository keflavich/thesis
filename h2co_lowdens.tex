\section{Low Density clouds in absorption}
In \citet{Ginsburg2011a}, we noted that the \formaldehyde densitometer revealed
volume densities much higher than expected given the cloud-average densities
from \thirteenco observations.  The densities were higher even than typical
turbulence.  However, this argument was made on the basis of a statistical argument;
here we attempt to demonstrate that the clumps in GMCs are of very high density
in individual clouds.

In order to detect low-density clouds, we must use bright background illumination sources
