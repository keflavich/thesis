\chapter{Bound HII regions and Young Massive Protoclusters}
\label{ch:ympc}


%\begin{abstract} 
    
We search the $\lambda=1.1$ mm Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey for clumps
containing sufficient mass to form $\sim10^4~\msun$ star clusters.
%by identifying
%compact ($r\lesssim2.5$ pc) massive ($M_{\rm clump}>10^4$ \msun) dust clumps.  
\ncandidates\ candidate massive proto-clusters  are identified in the first Galactic quadrant outside
of the central kiloparsec.  This
sample is complete to clumps with mass M$_{\rm clump}>\mmin$ and radius
$r\lesssim2.5$ pc.  The overall Galactic massive cluster formation rate is
$CFR({\rm M}_{\rm cluster}>10^4) \lesssim \CFR\  \permyr$, which is in
agreement with the rates inferred from Galactic open clusters and M31 massive
clusters.  We find that all massive proto-clusters in the first quadrant are
actively forming massive stars and place an upper limit of
$\tau_{starless}<\tsuplim$~Myr on the lifetime of the starless phase of massive
cluster formation.  If massive clusters go through a starless phase with all 
of their mass in a single clump, the lifetime of this phase is very short.

\section{Introduction}

The Milky Way contains about 150 Globular clusters (GCs) with masses of $10^4$
to over $10^6$ \msun\ and tens of thousands of open clusters containing from
100 to over $10^4$ stars.  However, young massive clusters containing
$\gtrsim10^4~\msun$ of stars are rare, with only a handful known
\citep{PortegiesZwart2010}. While no GCs have formed in the Milky Way within
the last 5 Gyr, open clusters that survive many crossing times continue to
form.   A few of these clusters have stellar masses greater than $10^4$
M$_{\odot}$ and therefore qualify as young massive clusters
\citep[YMCs;][]{PortegiesZwart2010}.   YMCs must either form from clumps having
masses greater than and sizes comparable to the final cluster  or be formed
from a larger, more diffuse reservoir, in which case massive protocluster
clumps may be rare or nonexistent  \citep{Kennicutt2012}.


%We assume an evolutionary sequence
%from `starless' to `starry' with gas present, after which the gas will be
%ejected, leaving behind a  massive cluster that will live for $\sim100$
%Myr \citep{PortegiesZwart2010}.  We distinguish `massive clusters' from
%lower-mass open clusters with $M<10^4$ \msun\ as they may form by different
%mechanisms.

%\todoeli{Check to make sure this is in agreement with your paper: }
Massive proto-clusters (MPCs) are massive clusters (M$_{\rm cluster}>10^4$ \msun)
in the process of forming from a dense gas cloud.  In \citet{Bressert2012}, we
examine the theoretical properties of MPCs: MPCs are assumed to form from
massive, cold starless clumps analagous to pre-stellar cores
\citep{Williams2000}.  In this paper, we refer to two classes of objects:
starless MPCs, which have very low luminosity and do not contain OB stars, and
MPCs, which are gas-rich but have already formed OB stars.  The only
currently known starless MPC is G0.253+0.016, which lies within the dense
central molecular zone and is subject to greater environmental stresses than
similar objects in the Galactic plane \citep{Longmore2012}.

Because massive clusters contain many massive stars, at some point during their
evolution ionization pressure will prevail over protostellar outflows as the
dominant feedback mechanism.  Other sources of feedback are less than
ionization pressure up until the first supernova explosion
\citep{Bressert2012}.  These proto-clusters must have masses
M$_{\rm clump}>{\rm M}_{*}/SFE$ \footnote{We define a star formation efficiency
$SFE={\rm M}_{\rm *,final} / {\rm M}_{\rm gas,initial}$.}, or about $3\ee{4}$ \msun\ for an assumed
SFE=30\% (an upper limit on the star formation efficiency),
confined in a radius $r\lesssim2.5$ pc, in order to remain bound against
ionization feedback.  These properties motivate our search for proto-clusters
in the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey \citep[BGPS;][
\url{http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/BOLOCAM_GPS/}]{Aguirre2011}.


The distinction between relatively short-lived `open clusters' and long-lived
($t\gtrsim1$ Gyr) bound clusters occurs at about $10^4$ \msun
\citep{PortegiesZwart2010}.  Clusters with ${\rm M}_{\rm cluster} < 1\ee{4} \msun$~will
be destroyed by interactions with giant molecular clouds over the course of a
few hundred million years after they have dispersed their gas
\citep{Kruijssen2011}, while clusters with ${\rm M}_{\rm cluster}\gtrsim10^4 \msun$ may
survive $\gtrsim 1$ Gyr.  Closer to the Galactic center, within approximately a
kiloparsec, all clusters will be destroyed on shorter timescales by strong
tidal forces or interactions with molecular clouds.
%Because the lower-mass clusters are destroyed on shorter
%timescales, it is difficult to get a complete census of their population;
%assessing their birth rate may be the best way to determine their overall
%population.

In the Galaxy, there are few known massive clusters.
\citet{PortegiesZwart2010} catalogs a few of them, of which NGC 3603, Trumpler
14, and Westerlund 1 and 2 are the likely descendants of the objects we
investigate.  These clusters have $r_{eff} \lesssim 1$ pc, $M\sim10^4$ \msun,
and ages $t\lesssim4$ Myr.  We present a census of their ancestral analogs.

% Bound open clusters and massive clusters may predominantly form from clumps with
% gravitational escape speeds greater than the sound-speed in photo-ionized gas.
% \S\ 2 uses the BGPS to identify
% candidate dense, massive clumps which may be progenitors to young massive
% clusters. Any clump for which  M$_{\rm clump} \times {\rm SFE}(30\%) > 10^4$
% \msun\ is considered to be a young massive proto-cluster (MPC). \ncandidates\ 
% candidates are sufficiently massive to produce clusters similar to  NGC 3603.
% \S\ 4 discusses these results and \S\ 5 provides concluding remarks.

The BGPS is a 1.1 mm survey of the first quadrant of the Galactic plane in the
range $-0.5 < b < 0.5$ with resolution $\sim33\arcsec$ sensitive to a maximum
spatial scale of $\sim120\arcsec$ \citep{Aguirre2011,Ginsburg2012}.  The BGPS `Bolocat' v1.0 catalog
includes sources identified by a watershed decomposition algorithm and flux
measurements within apertures of radius 20\arcsec, 40\arcsec, and 60\arcsec\
\citep{Rosolowsky2010}.

We searched the BGPS for candidate MPCs in the 1st quadrant ($6 < \ell < 90$;
5991 sources).  The inner 6 degrees of the Galaxy are excluded because physical
conditions are significantly different from those in the rest
of the galaxy  \citep{YusefZadeh2009} and the BGPS is confusion-limited in 
that region.

\subsection{Source Selection \& Completeness}
\label{sec:selection}
We identify a flux-limited sample by setting our search criteria to
include all sources with ${\rm M}_{\rm clump}>10^4$ \msun\ in a 20\arcsec\ radius out to 26 
kpc, or a physical radius of 2.5 pc at that distance.  The radius cutoff is
motivated by completeness and physical considerations: the cutoff of 26 kpc includes
the entire star forming disk in our targeted longitudes, and $r=2.5$ pc corresponds
to the radius at which a $3\ee{4}$ \msun\ mass has an escape speed $v_{esc}=10$ \kms, i.e.
ionized gas will be bound. 
The maximum radius and minimum mass imply a minimum mean density
$\bar{n}=6\times10^3~\percc$, which implies a maximum free-fall time $t_{ff}<0.65$~Myr.
%These limitations guide our analysis in Section \ref{sec:discussion}.

Using the Bolocat v1.0 catalog, we first set a flux limit on the sample by assuming
the maximum distance of $d=26$ kpc and imposing a mass cutoff of ${\rm M}_{\rm clump}\geq10^4$ \msun\ 
inside a 20\arcsec\ (2.5 pc) radius aperture.  Following equation 19 in
\citet{Aguirre2011}:
\begin{equation} 
    {\rm M}_{\rm gas}\approx 14.3 \left( e^{13.0/T_d}-1 \right)
        \left({S_\nu\over 1\; {\rm Jy}} \right)
        \left(\frac{D}{{\rm 1~kpc}}\right)^{2} \msun 
\end{equation}   
and assuming $T_{dust}=20$K, the implied flux cutoff is 1.13 Jy \footnote{As
per \citet{Rosolowsky2010}, \citet{Aguirre2011}, and \citet{Ginsburg2012}, a
factor of 1.5 calibration correction and 1.46 aperture correction are required
for the 20\arcsec\ radius aperture fluxes reported in the catalog.  These
factors have been applied to the data. }, above which \nsample\ `flux-cutoff'
candidates were selected in the Bolocat v1.0 catalog.  Cutoffs of 4.3 Jy for
the 40\arcsec\ and 10.2 Jy for the 60\arcsec\ Bolocat v1.0 apertures were used
to select more nearby candidates inside the same physical radius, but no
sources were selected based on these larger apertures.

%By measuring flux within an aperture, we are measuring the mass within a given
%radius, which means that the source may be substantially smaller than we
%assume.  The identified sources may therefore have higher escape velocities
%than the minimum $\sim10~\kms$ required.

% redundant? We applied a $M_{\rm clump} > 10^4$ \msun\ cutoff at
%the maximum distance of 17.5 kpc; we are therefore complete to a progenitor
%mass of $1\times10^4$ \msun.

The BGPS is insensitive to scales larger than 120\arcsec\
\citep[][]{Ginsburg2012}\footnote{\citet{Ginsburg2012} presents v2.0 of the
BGPS}.  As a result, the survey is incomplete below a distance $$D_{min} =
\mindist \left(\frac{r_{cluster}}{2.5 \textrm{pc}}\right) \textrm{kpc} $$ from
the Sun.  Within this radius, alternate methods must be sought to determine the
total mass within $r_{cluster} < \rcluster$ pc.  Although the sample is
incomplete for $D < \mindist$ kpc, sources that have sufficient mass despite
the 120\arcsec\ spatial filtering are included.

%We are
%able to identify some sources within this cutoff distance because they have
%enough mass in a smaller radius, but we are not complete at
%$D<\mindist$ kpc.
%Luckily, a great deal is known
%about nearby proto-clusters, and it is possible to determine the masses of many using
%alternate methods such as near and mid-infrared extinction.  These nearby star-forming
%regions are discussed in Section \ref{sec:nearcand}.

Distances to BGPS-selected candidates were determined primarily via literature
search.  Where distances were unavailable, we used velocity measurements from
\citet{Schlingman2011} and assumed the far distance for source selection.  We
then resolved the kinematic distance ambiguity towards these sources by
searching for associated near-infrared stellar extinction features from the
UKIDSS GPS \citep{Lucas2008}.
%and distances from \citet{EllsworthBowers2012} where
%literature distances were unavailable \footnote{\citet{EllsworthBowers2012} combine radial velocity measurements with 
%a variety of kinematic distance ambiguity resolution methods to measure a distance likelihood function for each source.
%We use the maximum likelihood distance from this method.}. 
Most literature distances were determined using a
rotation curve model and some method of kinematic distance ambiguity
resolution. Because the literature used different rotation curve models, there
is a $\sim10\%$ systematic error in distance resulting in a $\sim20\%$
systematic error in mass. We used the larger
40\arcsec\ radius apertures to determine the flux for sources at
$D<\middistcut$ kpc and 60\arcsec\ radius apertures for sources at $D<\mindist$
kpc (corresponding to $r<\rcluster$ pc).

% In addition, we used the radial velocity measurements from
% \citet{Schlingman2011} and \citet{Shirley2012} to determine a maximum mass for
% each source by assuming the source is at the far kinematic distance. This
% assures our survey's completeness even if the distances acquired from the above
% methods prove incorrect.  Even assuming the far distance for all flux-cutoff
% candidates, there are no additional sources with $M>3\times10^4$ \msun, though 
% there were a handful with $M>10^4 \msun$.


The masses were computed assuming a temperature $T_{dust}=20$K, opacity
$\kappa_{271.1 GHz} = 0.0114~\mathrm{cm}^2 \mathrm{g}^{-1}$, and gas-to-dust
ratio of 100  \citep{Aguirre2011} \footnote{$T_{dust}=20$K is more appropriate
for a typical pre-star-forming clump than an evolved HII-region hosting one
\citep[e.g.]{Dunham2010}. However, because we are interested in cold
progenitors as well as actively forming clusters, the selection is based on
$T_{dust}=20$K, which is more inclusive. }.  The mass estimate drops by a
factor of $2.38$ if the temperature assumed is doubled to $T_{dust}=40$K.  

\citet{Ginsburg2011} notes that significant free-free contamination, as high as
80\%, is possible for some 1.1 mm sources, so the selected candidates may prove
to be more moderate-mass and evolved proto-clusters.  We used the NRAO VLA
Archive Survey \citep[NVAS;][]{Crossley2008} to estimate the free-free
contamination for the sample.  For most sources, the free-free contamination
inferred from the VLA observations is small ($<20\%$), but for a subset the
contamination was $\sim20-35\%$ assuming that the free-free emission is
optically thin.  Corrected masses using the measured free-free contamination
and higher dust temperatures are listed in Table \ref{tab:candidates}; these
are reasonable lower limits on the total mass of these regions.  All of the
contamination estimates are technically lower limits both because of the
assumption that the free-free emission is optically thin and because the VLA
filters out large-scale flux.  However, in most cases, the emission is likely
to be dominated by optically thin emission \citep[evolved HII regions tend to
be optically thin and bright, while compact HII regions are optically thick but
relatively faint;][]{Keto2002} and for most sources VLA C or D-array
observations were used, and at 3.6 and 6 cm the largest angular scale recovered
is 180-300 \arcsec, greater than the largest angular scale in the BGPS.  

Applying a cutoff of M$_{\rm clump} > 10^4$ \msun\ left \ncandidates\
protocluster candidates out of the original \nsample.  The more stringent cut
M$_{\rm clump} > 10^4 / SFE \approx 3\ee{4}$ \msun\ leaves only \nMPC\ MPCs . 
% All of the \nsample\
% `flux-cutoff' candidates with $M>10^3$ \msun\ are shown in \figref{fig:galplot}
% providing context of their location in the Galaxy. 

The final candidate list contains only sources with $M(20K)>10^4 \msun$ (the
completeness limit; see Table \ref{tab:candidates}).  The table lists
their physical properties, their literature distance, their mass (assuming $T_{dust}=20
\textrm{~and~} 40 K$ and a free-free subtracted lower-limit) ,

% Ignored.  Unnecessary.
and their inferred escape speed ($v_{esc} = \sqrt{2 G M(20K) / r}$) assuming a
radius equal to the aperture size at that distance.  The table also includes
measurements of the IRAS luminosity in the 60 and 100 \um\ bands within the
source aperture.
%The literature search
%revealed that all candidates are known massive-star-forming regions.

\subsection{Source Separation}
These \ncandidates\ candidates include some overlapping sources.
There are two clumps in W51 separated by about 1.5 pc and 4.5 \kms\ along the
line of sight that are each independently massive enough to be classified as
MPCs, but are only discussed as a single entity because they are likely
to merge if their three-dimensional separation is similar to their projected
distance.  The candidates in W49 are more widely separated, about 4.4 pc and 7
\kms\ along the line of sight, but could still merge.

Additionally, 9 of the \ncandidates\ are within 8.7 kpc, so the mass
estimates are lower limits.  These are promising candidates for follow-up, but
cannot be considered complete for population studies.  If our radius restriction
is dropped to 1.5 pc, the minimum complete distance drops to 5.2 kpc and the
three lowest-mass sources in Table \ref{tab:candidates} no longer qualify, but
otherwise the source list remains unchanged.  Our analysis is therefore robust
to the selection criteria used.
%(except the W51 pair, which meets
%the selection criteria despite its proximity).

% Not really interesting?
% \subsection{Line Widths}
% To back up the claim that these proto-clusters cannot be unbound by ionization
% pressure, we examine the line widths in dense gas tracers.  Using a tracer that
% measures the internal motions  of the gas in the gravitational potential, we
% expect the approximately gaussian line-width to represent the quasi-equilibrium
% state of the gas (i.e., if the line width is changing, it is doing so slowly
% relative to the star formation process).  Because the line widths are much
% larger than the sound speed in the neutral gas, the observed clouds must be
% gravitationally bound, otherwise they would expand and their linewidths would
% drop to the sound speed on a dynamical timescale.
% %\todojohn{This is in keeping with results on GMCs, i.e. that they are in equilibrium.
% %Is there a better way to state it?  Are there other results / theoretical arguments that
% %should be cited?}
% 
% Heterodyne observations of HCO$^+$ 3-2 and N$_2$H$^+$ 3-2 data from
% \citet{Schlingman2011} are presented in Table \ref{tab:candidates}.  With
% critical densities $\gtrsim 2\ee{6}$ \percc, these both trace dense gas and therefore
% are limited to the proto-cluster region.  However, HCO$^+$ has frequently been
% observed in self-absorption, so the N$_2$H$^+$ widths are more reliable.
% We report the FWHM of single-component fits.  In order to mitigate the effects
% of self-absorption on the line fitting, we report HCO$^+$ line widths fitted by
% ignoring the central self-absorbed pixels; the channel selection was done by
% eye.
% All of the candidates selected as proto-massive-cluster candidates have
% $v_{internal} \approx v_{esc} > v_{ionized}$, confirming their candidacy.

%In Table 1 we provide a grading scheme to quantify the quality of the
%candidates. Candidates associated with a grade of {\bf A} will form a $\gtrsim
%10^4$ \msun\ cluster, even if $T_{dust}=40$K and SFE = 30\%, where it's mass is
%reduced from the estimates shown in Table 1 by a factor of 2.38. The two latter
%grades, {\bf B} and {\bf C}, follow the same assumptions and the candidates
%masses will fall down to $\sim 10^4$ \msun\ and $<10^4$ \msun, respectively. 



% \subsection{Nearby Candidates}
% \label{sec:nearcand}
% Because the BGPS is insensitive to large angular scales, we must resort to
% other methods for determining protocluster masses in nearby star-forming
% regions.
% The strongest candidates within 5.8 kpc are M17, NGC 7538, W3, S255, W43, W33, G34.15, and others?  While these
% regions are all known to be forming massive stars and have total gas reservoirs
% with $M>10^5$\msun, their large spatial extents mean that they are all more likely
% to form OB associations than bound clusters.  However, some are likely to be MPs...

%In the 3-6 kpc range, W43, W33

%For example, in the W3 region, no clumps have velocity dispersions
%$\sigma_{FWHM} > 6$ \kms, implying that none can keep ionized gas bound
%\citep{Bieging2011}.

% We searched the BGPS for candidate MPCs in the 1st quadrant ($6^o < \ell <
% 90^o$). Using the Bolocat catalog we marked sources with flux densities in a
% 20\arcsec\ aperture that yield a mass $M_{\rm clump}\geq 3\times 10^{4}$ \msun\
% at a distance of 17.5 kpc or less ($20\arcsec\ = 1.7 $ pc at 17.5 kpc)
% assuming $T_{dust}=20$K. We applied a $M_{\rm clump} \times {\rm SFE}(30\%) >
% 10^4$ \msun\ cutoff at the maximum distance of 17.5 kpc; we are therefore
% complete to a progenitor mass of $3\times10^4$\msun. These criteria led to a
% flux-density cutoff of 3.2 Jy, above which 16 candidates were detected in the
% Bolocat catalog. Distances to these candidates were determined via a
% literature search. The final candidate list is given in Table 1 along with
% their physical properties of measured line widths from N$_2$H+, their
% literature distance, their mass (assuming $T_{dust}=20 K$), and their
% inferred escape speed ($v_{esc} = \sqrt{2 G M / r}$) assuming a radius equal
% to the aperture size at that distance.  The literature search also revealed
% that all of our candidates are known star-forming regions, so our list
% contains no contaminants.  
% 
% With distance determinations to these candidates, we were able to compute
% masses assuming a temperature $T_{dust}=20$K, opacity \citep{Aguirre2010},
% and gas-to-dust ratio of 100 \footnote{$T_{dust}=20$K is more appropriate for
% a typical pre-star-forming clump than an evolved HII-region hosting one
% \citep[e.g.][]{Dunham2009}. However, because we are interested in cold
% progenitors as well as actively forming clusters, we estimate the masses of
% the cluster progenitor candidates using $T_{dust}=20$K or $T_{dust}=40$K to
% reflect whether the environment is cold and quiescent or actively forming
% stars. }
% The mass estimate drops by a factor $2.38$ if the temperature assumed is
% doubled to $T_{dust}=40$K. Additionally, for more nearby sources, larger
% apertures (corresponding to the same physical radius) were used to include
% more source flux. Applying a cutoff of M$_{\rm clump} \times {\rm SFE}(30\%)
% > 10^4$ \msun\ left 2 MPCs out of the 16. All of the 16 flux-cutoff
% candidates are shown in Figure \ref{fig:galplot} providing context on where
% they are in the Galaxy. 
% 
% In Table 1 we provide a grading scheme to quantify the quality of the candidates. Candidates associated with a grade of {\bf A} will form a $\gtrsim 10^4$ \msun\ cluster, even if $T_{dust}=40$K and SFE = 30\%, where it's mass is reduced from the estimates shown in Table 1 by a factor of 2.38. The two latter grades, {\bf B} and {\bf C}, follow the same assumptions and the candidates masses will fall down to $\sim 10^3$ \msun\ and $<10^3$ \msun, respectively. 

%\subsection{IRAS luminosities}
%We can and should derive IRAS luminosities for the candidates (this is trivial)
%and compare them to the IRAS luminosity function in the GP.  We can then
%extrapolate the observations to the southern hemisphere and be TRULY complete.

\section{Results}
% \subsection{Proto-Cluster Mass Function}
% \choppingblock
% In order to measure a mass function, we need better detection statistics than
% are provided by our \nMPC\ MPCs.  We note that our observations are complete to
% $M>5000\msun$ in the range $5.8 < D < 12.4$ kpc \todome{Is the 5000 \msun\
% cutoff used anywhere else?  I don't think so}.  In this range, there are
% \ncomplete\ candidates, which follow a mass function $\alpha=\plaw\pm\plawerr$
% \footnote{Computed using the \citet{Clauset2009} MLE as implemented at
% \url{http://code.google.com/p/agpy/wiki/PowerLaw}}.  If these candidates represent proto-clusters, they should
% follow a Schechter function with a cutoff near $10^4$ \msun\
% \citep{PortegiesZwart2010}.  However, the distribution is more consistent with
% a power law $\alpha=2$ than a Schechter function with a cutoff $M<5\times{10^5}
% \msun$.  Above this cutoff, the Schecter function and power-law are
% indistinguishable for our sample.  \todome{Discuss implications?  Not if
% chopped}



% unnecessary comment 
% The mass function of \emph{all} of our candidates independent of
% mass and distance is consistent with a power-law with $\alpha=1.8\pm0.1$ and
% completeness cutoff 800 \msun, but we don't believe this is a fair description
% of the observations because of the varying sensitivity with distance.

\subsection{Cluster formation rate}
\label{sec:cfr}

The massive clumps in Table \ref{tab:candidates} can be used to constrain the
Galactic formation rate of massive clusters (MCs) above \mmin\ if we assume
that the number of observed proto-clusters is a representative sample. The region
surveyed covers a fraction of the surface area of the Galaxy
$f_{observed}=A_{survey} / A_{Galaxy} \approx \obsfrac\%$ assuming the star
forming disk has a radius of 15 kpc\footnote{The observed fraction of the
galaxy changes to 21\% if we only include the area within the solar
circle as discussed in \S \ref{sec:discussion}.}.
%The fraction observed is also
%about 28\% if we assume the star-forming disk
%truncates at 13.5 instead of 15 kpc \citep{Kennicutt2012}.}.  
The cumulative
cluster formation rate above a cluster mass ${\rm M}_{cl}$ is given by $$CFR(>{\rm M}_{cl})
= \frac{N_{MPC}}{\tau_{SF} f_{observed}}$$ where $ \tau_{SF} \approx 2$\ Myr is
the assumed cluster formation timescale \footnote{$\tau_{SF}$, the time from the start of star formation
until gas expulsion, is a poorly understood
quantity, but is reasonably constrained to be $\gtrsim1$~Myr from the age
spread in the Orion Nebula cluster \citep{Hillenbrand1997} and $\lesssim10$~Myr
because the most massive stars will go supernova by that time.}.
% $v_{esc}$ is the escape speed from radius $R$ and $f_A \sim 0.1$ is the
% projected area filling-factor of dense star-forming gas in the clump.  Dense
% cores may survive for $f_A$ crossing-times before colliding.
%The cumulative
%cluster formation rate is given by
%$$
%CFR (>M_{cl}) = 
%{{f_A N_{MPC}(>M) [SFE ]V_{esc}  } 
%        \over 
% { 2 R f_{observed} }}
%$$
%where $f_A = 0.1$, $V_{esc} $= 10
%\kms , $R = \rcluster$ pc, and  $\tau_{SF} = 2$ Myr.  
With the measured
$N_{MPC}({\rm M}_{\rm cluster}>10^4\msun) = \nMPC $\ proto-clusters, we infer a Galactic formation rate 
$$CFR \lesssim \CFR \left(\frac{\tau_{SF}}{2
~\textrm{Myr}}\right)^{-1} \textrm{~Myr}^{-1}$$  This cluster formation rate is
statistically weak, with Poisson error of about 3.5 
\permyr\ and can be improved with more complete surveys \citep[e.g., Hi-Gal,][]{Molinari2010}.  This
formation rate is an upper limit because all of the estimated
masses are upper limits as discussed in Section \ref{sec:selection}.


\subsection{Comparison to Clusters in Andromeda}
%Comparison to Andromeda or direct measurements should provide a prediction of
%the number of clusters in the largest (two?) mass bins.  Do our observations
%agree with such a prediction?
%
%If YES, the implication is that cluster formation proceeds rapidly and
%forms massive, dense, proto-cluster "cores" before actually forming the
%cluster.

%If NO, cluster formation is SLOW and accretion onto the cluster after the
%initial formation may continue and increase cluster mass by factors $>2$ (less
%than that, it doesn't really matter).  In this case, predicting the cluster
%formation rate from protoclusters requires completeness down to smaller mass - 
%i.e., we need to be able to observe the cluster `seeds' in addition to the dense
%pre-clusters.

We use cluster observations in M31 from \citet{Vansevicius2009} to infer the
massive cluster formation rate in M31.  They observe 2 clusters with
${\rm M}_{\rm cluster}>10^4\msun$ and ages $<10$ Myr in 15\% of the M31 star-forming
disk.  The implied cluster formation rate in Andromeda is $\dot{N_{cl}} =
N_{cl}/0.15 / (10 ~\mathrm{Myr}) \approx 1.3$ \permyr.  Given M31's total star
formation rate $\sim 5\times$ lower than the Galactic rate \citep[Andromeda
$\mdot=0.4$, Milky Way $\mdot=2$ \msun \permyr;][]{Barmby2006,Chomiuk2011}, the
predicted Galactic cluster formation rate is $\dot{N_{cl}}(MW) = 5~
\dot{N_{cl}}(M31) = 6.5$ \permyr \citep[assuming the CFR scales linearly with
the SFR; ][]{Bastian2008}.  
%Given our assumed star formation timescale $\tau_{SF}$, the expected
%present-day number of clusters $N_{cl}(MW) = (6.5 \textrm{~MC~}\permyr) (\tau_{SF}) = 13$
%clusters in the Galaxy.  Using the mass cutoff of $3\times10^4$ \msun, we
%detect \nMPC\ MPCs, implying there are \nMPCtot\ MPCs in the galaxy.  
The scaled-up Andromeda cluster formation rate matches the observed Galactic
cluster formation rate.  The samples are small, but as a sanity check, the
agreement is comforting.

% \choppingblock
% The agreement between the M31-based
% prediction and our observations is (un?) remarkable, considering that Poisson
% statistics alone imply a $>50\%$ uncertainty in each of the cluster counts
% produced above.

% We present a CFR function dependent on the local surface density of gas in a 
% galaxy $\Sigma_{\rm gas}$ (normalized by $\Sigma_0 = Value$), the survival time 
% of the cluster $\tau$, and the initial mass of the cluster, $M_{init}$. We assume 
% that it has a functional form 
% $$ CFR = A \biggr[ {{\tau} \over {t_{10}}} \biggr] ^{\alpha} \biggr[ {{M_{init}} \over {M_3}} \biggr] ^{\beta} \biggr[ {{\Sigma_{\rm gas}} \over {\Sigma_0}} \biggr] ^{\gamma} $$ 
% in units of number of clusters forming per $10^6$ years (= 1 Myr) per square kpc. 
% Here $t_{10}$ is in units fo 10 Myr, and $M_3$ is in units of $10^3$ \msun . From 
% a fit to Galactic and extra-galactic cluster catalogs approximate values are $A = 2$ 
% to $5$ clusters per square kpc per Myr, $\alpha = -1.0$, $\beta = -1.5$, and 
% $\gamma = 1.5$. This implies a one square kpc region around the Sun contains 
% about 20 to 50 short-lived ($<$ 1 Myr) clusters or expanding associations ($\sim3*10^4$ 
% Galaxy wide), and forms only 0.2 to 0.5 open clusters (such as the Pleiades) per kpc$^{-2}$ that last 100 Myr.

% \subsubsection{Comparison to observed Galactic clusters}
% 
% \choppingblock
% 
% % Better to use Piskunov 2008 numbers
% %Given a cluster birth rate of 0.2-0.5 $\permyr \perkpc$ (Battinelli \&
% %Capuzzo-Dolcetta 1991, Piskunov et al. 2006), the expected number of clusters
% %between the CMZ (cut off at a Galactic radius of 1 kpc) and the solar circle at
% %8.5 kpc is 14-36 \permyr. However, the measured clusters in the reported
% %surveys are only $\sim 500 \msun$, while we are interested in more massive ($M
% %> 10^4\msun$) clusters. Assuming a power-law distribution with $\beta=2$ and
% %that the Piskunov sample measures a CFR for clusters in the range $100 < M_C <
% %1000 \msun$, we derive a CFR of $2-5\times10^{-4} \permyr \perkpc$. Assuming
% %these live $\sim 20$ Myr, corresponding to the longest lifetime in Portegies
% %Zwart et al's MC list, the expected number of massive clusters is
% %$\sim0.3-0.8$ within the solar circle. 
% % This number is FAR too low, considering that simply counting MCs gets you at least 7 XXXX 
% 
% 
%  \citet{Piskunov2008} claim a cluster formation rate
% of 0.4 \perkpc \permyr\ integrated over all local ($d<850$ pc) clusters.  Integrated over the Galactic 
% plane, this implies $CFR = 281 \permyr$.  However, the clusters observed in this 
% local sample all have large radii ($r>10$ pc) or small masses ($M<10^3 \msun$), 
% and therefore it is difficult to place constraints on the massive CFR from this data.
% 
% Given our observed cluster counts, there was only a 5\% probability
% of finding an $M>3\times10^4$ \msun\ proto-cluster and 17\% probability of an $M>10^4\msun$
% proto-cluster within the 850 pc completeness zone of \citet{Piskunov2008}.  Multiplying
% by the ratio of a MC / MP lifetime (about an order of magnitude) suggests that
% we were likely to find 1-2 objects with $M>10^4$ \msun\ in the Piskunov sample.
% None were found.  \todome{What are the chances of finding 0 in the local sample given
% the ``measured'' rate?}
% 
% \citet{Piskunov2008} also observe a steepening of the cluster mass function
% with age, from $\alpha\sim1$ to $\alpha\sim2$.  Our observed proto-cluster mass
% function is steep, with $\alpha\sim2$.  This contradiction suggests
% either a selection effect in the \citet{Piskunov2008} sample avoiding low-mass
% young clusters, that our sample \emph{under}estimates the cluster masses particularly
% on the high-mass end, or that low-mass proto-clusters live longer than
% high-mass proto-clusters.  The latter explanation would result in an excess of
% observable low-mass protoclusters compared to the cluster
% mass function (i.e., observable protoclusters should have $\alpha>2$).  It is also expected in theory since, for fixed radius,
% $t_{ff} \propto M^{-1/2}$.

\subsection{Star Formation Activity}

In the sample of potential proto-clusters, all have formed massive stars based
on a literature search and IRAS measurements.  A few of the low mass sources,
G012.209-00.104, G012.627-00.016, G019.474+00.171, and G031.414+00.307 have
relatively low IRAS luminosities ($L_{IRAS} = L_{100}+L_{60} < 10^5 \lsun$) and
little free-free emission.  However, \emph{all} are detected in the radio as
H~II regions (some ultracompact) and have luminosities indicating early-B type
powering stars.
%The lowest IRAS 100 \um\ luminosity in our sample is
%$L_{100}(G19.47)\approx6\times10^3 \lsun$; the rest have $L_{100} >
%2\times10^5 \lsun$.  All of the massive candidates therefore require O-type
%powering stars.

Non-detection of `starless' proto-cluster clumps implies an upper limit on the
starless lifetime. For an assumed $\tau_{sf} \sim 2$~Myr, the $1\sigma$ upper
limit on the starless proto-MC clump is $\tau_{starless} <
(\sqrt{N_{cl}}/N_{cl}) \tau_{sf} = \tsuplim~\mathrm{Myr}$ assuming Poisson
statistics and using all 18 sources.  This limit is consistent with massive
star formation on the clump free-fall timescale ($\tau_{ff}\leq0.65$ Myr).  It
implies that massive stars form rapidly when these large masses are condensed
into cluster-scale regions and hints that massive stars are among the first to
form in massive clusters.

%It may indicate that massive stars form simu
%before all of the proto-cluster mass
%has been collected into a compact region, i.e. that collapse from molecular
%cloud to proto-cluster clump proceeds after massive stars have ignited within
%the proto-cluster, although the small number statistics allow for other
%explanations.  

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

Assuming a lower limit 30\% SFE and T$_{dust} = 20 {\rm K}$, \nMPC\ candidates
in Table \ref{tab:candidates}  will become massive clusters like NGC 3603:
G010.472+00.026, W51, and W49 (G043.169+00.01).  Even if  T$_{dust} = 40 {\rm
K}$, W49 is still likely to form a $\sim10^4$ \msun\ MC, although G10.47 would
be too small.  W51, which is within the spatial-filtering incompleteness zone,
passes the cutoff and is likely to form a pair of massive clusters.  However,
if the dust in W51 is warm and the free-free contamination is considered, the
total mass in each of the W51 clumps is below the 3\ee{4} \msun\ cutoff.
% \todocara{Do massive clusters in the galactic center affect this discussion?
% Eli's comment: No, different physics in the GC mean we should not be
% concerned.}
% IGNORED unless the referee says otherwise

The BGPS covers about \obsfrac\% of the Galactic star-forming disk in the range
1 kpc $< R_{gal}<15$ kpc.  We can extrapolate our \nMPC\ detections to predict
that there are $\leq$\nMPCtot\ ($\pm \nMPCtoterr$) proto-clusters in the Galaxy
outside of the Galactic center.
The agreement between the SFR-based prediction
from M31 and our observations implies that we have selected genuine massive
proto-clusters (MPCs).  

These most massive sources have escape speeds greater than the sound speed in
ionized gas, indicating that they can continue to accrete gas even after the
formation of massive stars.  Assuming they are embedded in larger-scale gas
reservoirs, we are measuring lower bounds on the `final' clump plus cluster
mass. 

% Additionally, in the 15\% of the galaxy within the 5.8 kpc
% radius in which the survey is incomplete due to spatial filtering, we predict
% that there should be $2\pm1$ MPCs.  
% it's actually 41%, we probably predict more like a few....

We present MPC candidates that have $\Omega > 1$ and clump masses greater than $10^3$ \msun.

%this paragraph is somewhat in contradiction to Piskunov2008
% Open clusters generally have masses $<10^4$~\msun\ with a lifetime of $<1$~Gyr
% and their disruption can start early in life from their local environment
% \citep{PortegiesZwart2010}. MCs ($>10^4$~\msun) on the other hand are less
% sensitive to the surrounding environment than open clusters and typically
% remain bound for 1 $<$ t $<$ 10  Gyr \citep{PortegiesZwart2010}.


% look at Piskunov Figure 5 - Cluster Mass Functino

%Assuming that we have indeed acquired a complete sample of MPCs
%over their $\sim2 $ Myr lifetimes, this implies that clusters form within highly
%condensed clumps of gas and dust, rather than slowly accreting from large-scale
%mass reservoirs.  


%What of the locations of proto-clusters?  
All of the young massive proto-clusters candidates observed are within the
solar circle despite our survey covering more area outside of
the solar circle.  
%In other galaxies, e.g. M33, the most massive
%cluster (NGC 604) is found in the outer disk; this situation appears not to
%occur in the Milky Way.  
%Since both shear and density are higher in the inner
%galaxy, it appears that gas density is a more important factor than shear
%forces in determining where massive clusters form within the Galaxy.
%
The outer radius limit for massive cluster formation is consistent with the
observed metallicity shift noted at the same radius by \citet{Lepine2011}.
They identify the solar circle as the corotation radius of pattern speed and
orbits within the Galaxy (within this radius, stars orbit faster than the
spiral pattern).  The fact that this radius also represents a cutoff between
the inner, massive-cluster-forming disk and the outer, massive-cluster-free
disk hints that gas crossing spiral arms may be the triggering mechanism for
massive cluster formation.  However, given the small numbers, the detected
clusters are consistent with a gaussian + exponential disk distribution
following that described by \citet{Wolfire2003}.  
%Outside of 8.5 kpc, the open cluster metallicity is approximately flat out to
%20 kpc.  Inside 8.5 kpc, the metallicity increases.  If gas is prevented from
%mixing at the spiral arm corotation radius, a higher average gas density within
%that radius would lead to increased star and cluster formation.

% The presence of massive clusters exclusively in the inner galaxy ($R_{gal} <
% 8.5 kpc$) is a strong indication that these clusters form from giant molecular

% destroy lower-mass clusters \citep{PortegiesZwart2010}.  The survival time of a
% cluster is proportional to its density and inversely proportional to the GMC
% density.   Statistics on proto-clusters may therefore present a new tool for
% the study of cluster disruption.

%shy of half the potential-cluster-forming region. Then we should see three
%MPCs amongst the candidates we detected. The CFR estimates best agree with the
%conditions that our MPC candidates have T$_{dust} = 20 {\rm K}$ and SFE of
%30\% to 50\% (2 or 4 MPCs). 
%Regarding the lower mass candidates (10$^3$ \msun), we would expect to find $\sim 10$ open cluster progenitors. We have 14 such candidates, which is within a factor of two of the CFR estimate. 


Future work should include a census for MPCs within $D\lesssim5$ kpc using the
Herschel Hi-Gal survey \citep{Molinari2010} and in the Southern plane with
ATLASGAL \citep{Schuller2009}.  Some surveys have already identified
proto-clusters in these regions \citep[e.g.][]{Faundez2004,Battersby2011}, but
they are not complete.  A complete survey of distances will be essential for
continuum surveys to be used.

% Added as per Referee's comments
There are two modes of massive cluster formation consistent with our
observations that can be observationally distinguished.  Either a compact
starless massive proto-cluster phase does occur and is short, or the mass to be
included in the cluster is accumulated from larger volumes over longer
timescales.  Extending our proto-cluster survey to the Southern sky, e.g. using
the ATLASGAL and Hi-Gal surveys, will either discover starless MPCs or
strengthen the arguments that there is no starless MPC phase.  If instead
massive clusters form by large scale ($r>2.5$ pc) accretion, substantial
reservoirs of gas should surround these most massive regions and be flowing
into them.  Signatures of this accretion process should be visible: MPCs should
contain molecular filamentary structures feeding into their centers
\citep[e.g.][]{Correnti2012,Hennemann2012,Liu2012}.  Alternatively, lower mass
clumps may merge to form massive clusters \citep{Fujii2012}, in which case
clusters of clumps - which should be detectable in extant galactic plane
surveys - are the likely precursors to massive clusters.  Finally, massive
clusters may form from the global collapse of structures on scales larger than
we have probed, which could also produce clusters of clumps.


\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:ympcconclusions}

Using the BGPS, we have performed the first flux-limited census of massive
proto-cluster candidates.  We found \ncandidates\ candidates that will be part
of the next generation of open clusters and \nMPC\ that could form massive
clusters similar to NGC 3603 (${\rm M}_{\rm cluster} > 10^4$ \msun).   We have
measured a Galactic massive cluster formation rate $CFR({\rm M}_{\rm
cluster}>10^4) \lesssim \CFR\  \permyr$\ assuming that clusters are equally
likely to form everywhere within the range 1 kpc $ < R_{gal} < $ 15   kpc. 
%however, we think formation limited to 1<r<8.5; what does this imply?
%(the CFR is the same if we assume, as observed, that all massive cluster formation occurs within the solar circle).  
The observed MPC counts are
consistent with observed cluster counts in Andromeda scaled up by $SFR_{M31} /
SFR_{MW}$ assuming a formation timescale of 2 Myr.  
%A lack of massive clusters
%detected in the local neighborhood \citep[$d_{max}\sim 850$ pc]{Piskunov2008} is also
%consistent with the MPC detection rate and assumed lifetime.

Despite this survey being the first sensitive to pre-star-forming MPC clumps, none
were detected.  This lack of detected pre-star-forming MPCs suggests a
timescale upper limit of about $\tau_{starless}<\tsuplim$ Myr for the pre-massive-star phase of
massive cluster formation, and hints that massive clusters may never form
highly condensed clumps ($\bar{n}\gtrsim10^4~\percc$) prior to forming massive
stars.
It leaves open the possibility that massive clusters form from large-scale
($\gtrsim 10$ pc) accretion onto smaller clumps over a prolonged ($\tau > 2$
Myr) star formation timescale.


Observations are needed to distinguish competing models for MC formation:
Birth from isolated massive proto-cluster clumps, either compact and rapid
or diffuse and slow, or from smaller clumps that
never have a mass as large as the final cluster
mass.  
This sample of the \ncandidates\ most massive proto-cluster clumps in the first
quadrant (where they can be observed by both the VLA and ALMA) presents an ideal
starting point for these observations.
